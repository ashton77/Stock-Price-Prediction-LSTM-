# Stock-Price-Prediction-LSTM-
This repository contains all code required to build a simple LSTM autoencoder based Time-Series prediction model web app.

The LSTM Encoder-decoder is a seq-to-seq neural network used for prediciton of sequencial data such as Time-Series, Natural Language processing etc. Prediction of Stock prices is a time series problem and has been addressed using a basic LSTM Encoder-Decoder model.

The main code resides in the app.py file which contains the routes and functions to predict the future close price. The supporting HTML and CSS files reside in the templates and statis folders respectively.

How to execute:
1. Clone the repo
2. Go to the folder location 
3. Type ```python app.py``` in the cmd to run
